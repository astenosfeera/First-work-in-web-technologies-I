			<td>It will be difficult and interesting at the same time. Useful for me.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Tīmekļa tehnoloģijas II (KP:4)</td>
			<td>final exam?, something else</td>
			<td>Also useful. I need to learn JS but it's a bit hard when I need to learn C++ and maths ar the same time, but very useful.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Datoru tīklu administrēšana (KP:3)</td>
			<td>Later will fill</td>
			<td>This was an optional course and it was not the easiest option - but it 100% will be interesting and useful even if it will be a lot info to process for my brains.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Datu bāzes un informācijas sistēmu pamati (KP:4)</td>
			<td>Later will fill</td>
			<td>Ok, this one will be messy but actually it is very important course and it is said this is something that is used in workplaces.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Lineārā algebra I (KP:3)</td>
			<td>4 tests, I gues that's it</td>
			<td>This course I chose just because it will be just haf semester, I like profesor Juris and someone said it's easier than English course because less homework 
				to do, but otherwise I wouldn't chose anything like this ever.</td>

			<td>Matemātiskā analīze I (KP:3)</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Izlīdzinošā matemātika: trigonometrija, ģeometrija</td>

<h1>Travelling</h1>
<h2>Cyprus</h2>
<p class = "unimportantP">I decided to go to Cyprus on my birthday which is on 29.11. Found a cheap flights to Cyprus.
	"That's it" I thought. It is around +24 degrees still and I want to feel like in summer. A bit more sun, a bit more light.
	I stayed in Paphos for 2 nights, in mountain village near mount. Olympus for 2 nights and then near Larnaca - you guessed it correctly - again for 2 nights.
	On Paphos side I visited canyon and hiked there but the storm with rain and thunder started. It was adventurous!
After I visited a half-drown ship. 
Then I visited mountain and hiked around Olympus mountain. And the final days I spent in Larnaca and went to sea caves, 
Ayia Napa beach and met 2 girls from South America. :] (this actually happened in 2025 but other things are written in 1.course)

<h1>Reviews</h1>
<h2>X-files</h2>
<p>I've decided to rewatch all seasons of X-files. I actually never watched all seasons but just some random episodes when I was a kid. Currently I've watched 14 episodes of
	first season. I can tell it's a bit old - 90s fashion and the quality of making special effects is lower than nowadays. But it still has its charm. I have 
	a calming feeling when I watch it. Some episodes feel like fillers. I think the one I liked the least was "Space". There are patterns and similar structure to some episodes. 
	For example there was a guy who could control fire and in another serie there was a guy who could deform his body to move in shafts and then to kill people. Same
	motives but different superpower so to say. But I really liked one of the first episodes about alien technologies - not really technologies but the atmosphere and Fox Mulder
	seeing an alien space ship. :D It was funny but nice. Another of my favorites was Squeeze - the one I already mentioned - guy deforming in shafts - it was a bit scary.
	Another one - Scully finally saw something extraordinary was in "Beyond the Sea" and the next one "Gender Bender". Those two also were my favorites.
